# rtcstats-server

The rtcstats-server represents the server side component of the rtcstats ecosystem, the client side being
https://github.com/jitsi/rtcstats which collects and sends WebRTC related statistics.

## Requirements

- node v12 or above
- npm v6 or above

## Architecture

Comming soon...

## How to use
### Run
```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
### Configure
The server is configured using the node [config](https://github.com/jitsi/rtcstats-server/blob/master/config/) module thus it will use one of the available config yaml files
found under the ./config directory in accordance to the NODE_ENV (debug|production) environment variable.

Default values can be seen here [default](https://github.com/jitsi/rtcstats-server/blob/master/config/default.yaml).

There are also some additional env variables that can be set in order do overwrite config options from
the command line, these can be found here [custom-env-var](https://github.com/jitsi/rtcstats-server/blob/master/config/custom-environment-variables.yaml)

### Configure feature database connector.
One function of the server is to extract a feature set from the gathered stats, these extracted features
are then sent do an database endpoint of some sort, such as bigquery, firehose or amplitude.

Bellow is a list of the current supported features:

Important Note. There are more features available, mostly related to track specific stats, but as it
stands the only enabled database endpoint is amplitude! limiting the format of a sent feature object.

Because of this limitation we can't send track specific statistics as they contain multiple nested
objects and arrays and, as mentioned above, amplitude doesn't play well with that type of structuring.
So for time being track stats are disabled.

### Amplitude Integration
Amplitude can be configured by simply setting the following config value:
```
amplitude:
    key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Currently the extracted features sent, are a hardcoded list, this will change in a future iteration.

List of features sent as a amplitude event:
```
- calledGetUserMediaRequestingScreen
- calledGetUserMediaRequestingAudio
- calledGetUserMediaRequestingVideo
- firstAudioTrackLabel
- firstVideoTrackLabel
- lifeTime
- ICEFailure
- connectionTime
- numberOfRemoteStreams
- sessionDuration
- bytesTotalSent
- bytesTotalReceived
- statsMeanRoundTripTime
- statsMeanReceivingBitrate
- statsMeanSendingBitrate
- statsMeanAudioPacketsLost
- statsMeanVideoPacketsLost
- firstCandidatePairType
- bweGoogActualEncBitrateMean
- bweGoogRetransmitBitrateMean
- bweGoogTargetEncBitrateMean
- bweGoogTransmitBitrateMean
- bweAvailableOutgoingBitrateMean
- bweAvailableIncomingBitrateMean

```
Information regarding the amplitude identity of the associated client is also sent. It's gathered
by the rtcstats client and send along with the rest of the statistics. This is required so we can associate the rtcstats event which is called `rtcstats-publish` with the events generated client side.
